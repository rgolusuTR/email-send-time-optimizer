# Sample Stakeholder Mapping Configuration
# Copy this file to config/stakeholders.yaml and customize for your organization

stakeholders:
  # Exact URL matches - for specific pages
  exact_matches:
    "/about-us/": "marketing@company.com"
    "/contact/": "marketing@company.com"
    "/careers/": "hr@company.com"
    "/privacy-policy/": "legal@company.com"
    "/terms-of-service/": "legal@company.com"
    "/investor-relations/": "investor-relations@company.com"

  # Pattern matches - for URL patterns using wildcards
  pattern_matches:
    "*/products/*": "product-team@company.com"
    "*/blog/*": "content-team@company.com"
    "*/news/*": "marketing@company.com"
    "*/support/*": "support@company.com"
    "*/docs/*": "technical-writing@company.com"
    "*/api/*": "engineering@company.com"

  # Department fallbacks - when no specific match is found
  department_fallbacks:
    marketing: "marketing@company.com"
    product: "product-team@company.com"
    engineering: "engineering@company.com"
    support: "support@company.com"
    content: "content-team@company.com"
    legal: "legal@company.com"
    hr: "hr@company.com"
    default: "webmaster@company.com"
# Configuration Notes:
# 1. Exact matches take priority over pattern matches
# 2. Pattern matches use simple wildcard matching (*)
# 3. Department fallbacks are used when no URL match is found
# 4. The 'default' fallback is used when no department can be determined
# 5. All email addresses should be valid and monitored
